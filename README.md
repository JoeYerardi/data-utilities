This repo holds scripts that were written to accomplish a particular task but will likely come in handy in the future.

split_cadocs.sh

I wrote this shell (Bash) script to take a csv file of payments from drug makers and medical device manufactures to California doctors that contained more than 1.1 million records and split it into multiple csv files of at most 200,000 records.

process_assessments.py

I wrote this Python script to take a minimally formatted text file of annual parcel-level assessment (property tax) data and process it into a clean, comma-separated text file.
